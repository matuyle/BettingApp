Demo Application on Android, built using the latest technologies and following best practices in mobile development. I implemented **Clean Architecture** and followed it
as well as i could :).which ensures a clear separation of concerns and a scalable and maintainable codebase. The **MVVM** pattern was used to provide a clear separation between the presentation 
layer and the business logic.To improve the performance and make the code testable, I used **Dagger Hilt** for dependency injection. This allows for easy testing of the 
different components of the application, as well as for easy replacement of dependencies in the future.To handle data persistence, I used **Room** which is a powerful 
and flexible library from Android Jetpack that makes it easy to work with SQLite databases.I also used **Jetpack Compose**, which is the latest UI toolkit from Android, 
to build the user interface. It provides a modern and reactive way to create UIs, making the code more expressive and easier to understand.For making API requests,
i used **Retrofit**. It allows for easy creation of REST clients and provides a lot of flexibility when it comes to handling different types of responses. I used **mocky.io** 
to mock the api requests.Overall, our Demo Application is a great example of how to build a modern and scalable Android application that follows best practices 
and uses the latest technologies. 
I hope you will enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it, and let me know when you see something fishy that needs to be fixed!
